# TODO

## Code intelligence

* Bookkeeping of chained object operators like WC()->cart->subtotal
* Bookkeeping of variables inside classes with multiple methods seems to not work
* Move bookkeeping and imenu generation to main thread to be able to populate Sematic Subsystem in the future
* Catch signaling from AST-generation, bookkeeping and imenu generation
* Imenu-generation of conditionally defined functions and classes
* Bookkeeping of class properties inside condition lists

## Other

* Support for mmm-mode or similar?
* Build in eldoc support like php-eldoc?
