## Indentation

* Case 1

        $table = $installer->getConnection()
            ->newTable($installer->getTable('my_table'))
            ->addColumn();


## Code intelligence

* Bookkeeping of chained object operators like WC()->cart->subtotal
* Bookkeeping of variables inside classes with multiple methods seems to not work
* Move bookkeeping and imenu generation to main thread to be able to populate Sematic Subsystem in the future
* Catch signaling from AST-generation, bookkeeping and imenu generation
* Imenu-generation of conditionally defined functions and classes
* Bookkeeping of class properties inside condition lists
* Fix race-condition in incremental parser when running asynchronous using threads

Perform an edit while an incremental parse is going to reproduce

Fix by reloading file or running C-r to rescan and clear cache
